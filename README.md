## WHAT IS THIS		
This is a Blog using jekyll a static blog generator written in  Ruby
its base in something call gems that in local are saved in
/home/dan/.gem/gems/minima-2.5.1/_includes/social.html but  because i change some of the formatting  that this files provide 
and i wanted  changes to show on GitHub Pages, and copy and paste the folder:


to know what each of those files  do or are ment fore i recommend to  read the oficial documentation of jekyll

to run the docs file in  a locall server  run in the folder console:

bundle exec jekyll serve, this will: run a local server in your machine so you cna see how your site is been render

 the gems are in 
the _includes folder is override in the  docs file
